       "         'A layered portrait of a troubled genius for whom art was not merely a thing of beauty but a vital part of living itself.\\nSelling Points: The original Marathi book won the National Award for Best Book on Cinema (in 1986), now available for the first time in English.\\nThe Book: Guru Dutt is now named along with the masters of world cinema—like Orson Welles, Mizoguchi, Hitchcock, Jancso, Ophuls—for his innovative cinematic form and his deep humanism and compassion. In Guru Dutt: A Tragedy in Three Acts, renowned film-maker and scholar Arun Khopkar sheds new light on Dutt’s genius through a close examination of Dutt’s three best-known films—Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool and Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam. With a nuanced eye, Khopkar explores the historical context which influenced Dutt’s deeply melancholic style while also analyzing the intricacies of the medium—acting, lighting, music, editing, rhythm—that Dutt carefully deployed to create his masterpieces. Originally written in Marathi, this exquisite English translation paints a layered portrait of a troubled genius for whom art was not merely a thing of beauty but a vital part of living itself.': 2,\n",
       "         '\"During the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre\"\\n\\nWritten during the turmoil of the English Civil War, Leviathan is an ambitious and highly original work of political philosophy. Claiming that man\\'s essential nature is competitive and selfish, Hobbes formulates the case for a powerful sovereign—or \"Leviathan\"—to enforce peace and the law, substituting security for the anarchic freedom he believed human beings would otherwise experience. This worldview shocked many of Hobbes\\'s contemporaries, and his work was publicly burnt for sedition and blasphemy when it was first published. But in his rejection of Aristotle\\'s view of man as a naturally social being, and in his painstaking analysis of the ways in which society can and should function, Hobbes opened up a whole new world of political science.\\n\\nBased on the original 1651 text, this edition incorporates Hobbes\\'s own corrections, while also retaining the original spelling and punctuation, to read with vividness and clarity. C. B. Macpherson\\'s introduction elucidates one of the most fascinating works of modern philosophy for the general reader.\\n\\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.': 3,\n",

Style, for Orwell, was never simply a question of aesthetics; it was always inextricably linked to politics and to truth.'All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.'Language is a political issue, and slovenly use of language and cliches make it easier for those in power to deliberately use misleading language to hide unpleasant political facts. Bad English, he believed, was a vehicle for oppressive ideology, and it is no accident that 'Politics and the English Language' was written after the close of World War II.\": 1,\n",

Bear Grylls: Two All-Action Adventures combines two of his greatest adventures told in Facing Up and Facing the Frozen Ocean. At the age of twenty-three, Bear Grylls became one of the youngest Britons to reach the summit of Mount Everest. At extreme altitude youth holds no advantage over experience, nevertheless, only two years after breaking his back in a freefall parachuting accident, he overcame severe weather conditions, fatigue and dehydration to stand on top of the world's highest mountain. Facing Up is the story of his adventure, his courage and humour, his friendship and faith. Facing the Frozen Ocean tells of a carefully calculated attempt to complete the first unassisted crossing of the frozen north Atlantic in an open rigid inflatable boat.

In 1983, he made an incendiary speech during the Assam elections in which the presence of ‘Bangladeshi foreigners’ in the state was a big issue.

Using fresh empirical data and first-hand accounts, the volume attempts to understand the reason why CFVs continue to take place between India and Pakistan despite consistent efforts to reduce the tension between the two nations. In doing so, it recontextualizes and enriches the prevailing arguments in contemporary literature on escalating dynamics and unenduring ceasefire agreements between the two South Asian nuclear rivals.': 1,\n",

On board are a desperate group of people, each with a secret to guard, each willing to kill to keep that secret safe.\\nWho or what is the dissolute Englishman, Farnholme?

       "         \"If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny - it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's writing has never been sharper and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future. This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumour joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet - and it just might be his very best.\": 1,\n",

Our policies are geared relentlessly towards increasing our standard measure of growth, Gross Domestic Product. By this yardstick we have never been wealthier or happier. So why doesn't it feel that way? Why are we living in such fractured times, with global populism on the rise and wealth inequality as stark as ever?\\nIn a book that is simultaneously trenchant, thought-provoking and entertaining, Pilling argues that we need to measure our successes and failures using different criteria. While for economic growth, heroin consumption and prostitution are worth more than volunteer work or public services, in a rational world we would learn how to value what makes economies better, not just what makes them bigger. So much of what is important to our wellbeing, from clean air to safe streets and from steady jobs to sound minds, lies outside the purview of our standard measure of success. We prioritise growth maximisation without stopping to think about the costs.\\nIn prose that cuts through the complex language so often wielded by a priesthood of economists, Pilling argues that our steadfast loyalty to growth is informing misguided policies - and contributing to a rising mistrust of experts that is shaking the very foundations of our democracy.\": 2,\n",

       "         \"Our personal space is dear to us all. We live our lives in full public view on social media - posting photos of the food we just ate or even expressing intimate feelings for our loved ones - but there are still things we would rather not share with the world. Indeed, it is privacy that sets man apart from the animals who must stick together in the wild for their own safety. But mankind was not born private. Our primitive ancestors too lived in large groups, every member of which knew all there was to know about the others. Privacy evolved over time as man developed technologies to wall himself off, even as he remained part of the society at large. But just as some technologies enhanced privacy, others - such as the printing press or the portable camera - chipped away at it. Every time this happened, man opposed the technology at first but made his peace with it eventually to benefit from the obvious good it could do. We are at a similar crossroads today with data technologies. Aadhaar is one example of the many ways in which we have begun to use data in everything we do. While it has made it far easier to avail of services from the government and private enterprises than ever before, there are those who rightly worry about people's private data being put to ill use - and, worse, without consent. But this anxiety is no different from that which we felt during the teething troubles of every previous technology we adopted. What we really need is a new framework that unlocks the full potential of a data-driven future while still safeguarding what we hold most dear - our privacy. In this pioneering work, technology lawyer Rahul Matthan traces the changing notions of privacy from the earliest times to its evolution through landmark cases in the UK, US and India. In the process, he re-imagines the way we should be thinking about privacy today if we are to take full advantage of modern data technologies, cautioning against getting so obsessed with their potential harms that we design our laws to prevent us from benefiting from them at all.\": 1,\n",

It starts in the nineteenth century with Nusserwanji Tata - a middle-class Parsi priest from the village of Navsari in Gujarat, and widely regarded as the Father of Indian Industry - and ends with Ratan Tata - chairman of the Tata Group until 2012.

This is evident in this collection of letters that Jawaharlal Nehru sent to his daughter Indira when she was 10 years old. This book, 'Letters from a Father to His Daughter' is a collection of 30 letters sent in the year 1928 which has become a phenomenal piece of literature over the years because it puts a lot of light on the bond between a father and his daughter and the many things that Pandit Nehru tried to explain to her while being away on business. Originally written in English, these letters are still relevant over a span of ninety years and that is exactly where their beauty lies.\\nDiverse Letters\\nThe collection of these letters spans over a large range and has many topics covered in it. Nehru began writing to his 10-year-old daughter when she was in Mussourie and he was in Allahabad. In order to tell his daughter about all the wonderful things in the world and his many thoughts on people and the society, he wrote her diverse letters that initially spoke of how the earth was formed, how animal and human life came into existence and how societies entered the fray. Nehru further also writes about races, faith and beliefs that existed in those times. The letters cover a major portion of human history and the history of India as well.\\nHardcover Book\\nThis is one of the finest books published by Penguin India. The best thing about this book is that since it has stood the test of time and seems relevant ninety years later, it sure is something that can be handed down from one generation to another. For these reasons, Penguin has compiled the book in a rather solid manner with a hardcover.\\nAbout the Author\\nJawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister of Independent India. Born on November 14, 1889, he was one of the most prominent political figures when India was at the peak of its struggle for freedom. Nehru was an alumnus of the Trinity College, Cambridge.

At the very outset of what promises to be a tumultuous season for the Red Devils, Andrew J Kirby investigates in his latest book Jose Mourinho: The Art of Winning whether the latest controversial move by the club\\x92s owners is a marriage made in heaven or hell.

Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo apart, the biggest, most marketable stars in world football today are the managers. The 2016-17 edition of the FA Premier League is being billed as the most exciting yet, and that\\x92s not because of the influx of star players after the European Championships in France.

And so it is on the manager\\x92s shoulders that the responsibility for delivering the customary Premier League spectacle falls. Incorporating interviews with fans (of United, and of Mourinho\\x92s former clubs), players (past and present), commentators and journalists, this book endeavours to determine what effect the Jose Mourinho show will have on Manchester United as a football club and the Premier League as a whole by tackling eight key questions including the following: Is Mourinho the best manager in the game?What is the management approach of Jose Mourinho? Can Manchester United tolerate the dark side of Jose Mourinho?What is the role of the modern day Premier League manager and how has this changed over the years?And:\\x93Once a Blue, always a Red?\\x94Can a manager who is so recognisably a Blue become a Red?Stuffed full of statistical detail and flavoured with a wistful view of a game, he sets the spectacular scene for a showdown of showdowns in this season\\x92s Premier League campaign where the ultimate prize for United will be the crucial return to the Champions League.

       "         \"When Aatish Taseer first came to Benares, he was eighteen, the Westernized child of an Indian journalist and a Pakistani politician, raised among the intellectual and cultural elite of New Delhi. Nearly two decades later, Taseer leaves his life in Manhattan to go in search of the Brahmins, wanting to understand his own estrangement from India through their ties to tradition. Known as the twice-born - first into the flesh, and again when initiated into their vocation - the Brahmins are a caste devoted to sacred learning. But what Taseer finds in Benares, the holy city of death, is a window on an India as internally fractured as his own continent-bridging identity. At every turn, the seductive, homogenizing force of modernity collides with the insistent presence of the past. From the narrow streets of the temple town to a Modi rally in Delhi, among the blossoming cotton trees and the bathers and burning corpses of the Ganges, Taseer struggles to reconcile magic with reason, faith in tradition with hope for the future and the brutalities of the caste system, all the while challenging his own myths about himself, his past, and his countries old and new. The Twice-born is a deeply individual, acutely perceptive, urgently relevant book: it revolves around questions of culture and politics that are going to define our future as a nation. But beyond the inherent interest of the stories it tells, it is a wonderfully written book, characterised by the music of Aatish Taseer's prose, which will haunt the reader long after the final page has been turned.\": 1,\n",

As Buf\\xadfett’s fortune and reputation grew over time, Loomis used her unique insight into Buffett’s thinking to chronicle his work for Fortune, writ\\xading and proposing scores of stories that tracked his many accomplishments—and also his occa\\xadsional mistakes.\\nNow Loomis has collected and updated the best Buffett articles Fortune published between 1966 and 2012, including thirteen cover stories and a dozen pieces authored by Buffett himself. Loomis has provided commentary about each major arti\\xadcle that supplies context and her own informed point of view. Readers will gain fresh insights into Buffett’s investment strategies and his thinking on management, philanthropy, public policy, and even parenting. Some of the highlights include:\\nThe 1966 A. W. Jones story in which Fortune first mentioned Buffett.\\nThe first piece Buffett wrote for the magazine, 1977’s “How Inf lation Swindles the Equity Investor.”\\nAndrew Tobias’s 1983 article “Letters from Chairman Buffett,” the first review of his Berk\\xadshire Hathaway shareholder letters.\\nBuffett’s stunningly prescient 2003 piece about derivatives, “Avoiding a Mega-Catastrophe.”\\nHis unconventional thoughts on inheritance and philanthropy, including his intention to leave his kids “enough money so they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.”\\nBill Gates’s 1996 article describing his early impressions of Buffett as they struck up their close friendship.\\nScores of Buffett books have been written, but none can claim this work’s combination of trust between two friends, the writer’s deep under\\xadstanding of Buffett’s world, and a very long-term perspective.': 1,\n",

       "         'There is perhaps no political figure in modern history who did more to secure and protect the Indian nation than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. But, ironically, seventy years after Patel brought together piece by piece the map of India by fusing the princely states with British India to create a new democratic, independent nation, little is understood or appreciated about Patel\\'s enormous contribution to the making of India. Caricatured in political debate, all the nuances of Patel\\'s difficult life and the daring choices he made are often lost, or worse, used as mere polemic. If Mahatma Gandhi was the spiritual core of India\\'s freedom struggle and Jawaharlal Nehru its romantic idealism, it was Sardar Patel who brought in the vital pragmatism which held together the national movement and the first ideas of independent India. A naturally stoic man, Patel, unlike Gandhi or Nehru, wrote no personal history. He famously argued that its was better to create history than write it. This is why even his deepest misgivings and quarrels have been easily buried. But every warning that Patel left for India - from the dangers of allowing groups to create private militias to his thoughtful criticism on India\\'s approach to Kashmir, Pakistan and China - are all dangerously relevant today. It is impossible to read about Patel, who died in 1950, and not feel that had he lived on, India might have been a different country. It is also impossible to ignore Patel and understand not only what the idea of India is but also what it could have been, and might be in the future. The Man Who Saved India is a sweeping, magisterial retelling of Sardar Patel\\'s story. With fiercely detailed and pugnacious anecdotes, multiple award-winning, best-selling writer Hindol Sengupta brings alive Patel\\'s determined life of struggle and his furious commitment to keep India safe. This book brings alive all the arguments, quarrels and clashes between some of the most determined people in Indian history and their battle to carve out an independent nation. Through ravages of a failing body broken by decades of abuse in and outside prison, Patel stands out in this book as the man who, even on his death bed, worked to save India. Hindol Sengupta\\'s The Man Who Saved India is destined to define Patel\\'s legacy for future generations.\\nPraise for the book:\\nSardar Patel was the silent one of the trinity along with Gandhi and Nehru who dedicated his life. In the struggle for an independent India. His lasting legacy is a United India rather than the land which throughout history has-been split in rival warring kingdoms. Hindol Sengupta has given us the story of Sardar\\'s life for the new generations of India so that they could understand and admire a unique personality. Read this book and discover India\\'s history in the first half the last century. And reclaim your legacy.\\n- Lord Meghnad Desai, bestselling author and economist\\n\"It is dangerous to put dreamers in power. Sardar Patel\\'s pragmatism was the perfect antidote to Nehru\\'s idealism in the early years of Independence. If only Patel had lived longer, India would have been spared the excesses of the License Raj and the Kashmir problem. This is one of the messages of this lively, highly readable book.\"\\n- Gurcharan Das, bestselling author\\nThe Man Who Saved India is the most authoritative and accessible biography of Sardhar Vallabhbhai Patel, lovingly referred to as the \\'Iron Man of India\\'. In this book, written in his impeccable narrative style, Hindol Sengupta rescues the memory of the beloved leader of India from the vaults of obscurity. This book brings out the true story of independence as well as stability of India following it, which was achieved through sweat and blood of its leaders like Patel.\\nThe Man who Saved India reverses one of the historical ironies of modern India through bringing into light many of the unknown facts of the life of Patel, based on the author\\'s field visits, interviews, and extensive research, which is an onerous task in itself considering the fact that Patel neither maintained records of his work nor preserved his documents of communications.\\nHindol begins the narration of larger than life tale of Patel describing his visit to the birth home of Patel in Nadiad, now in dilapidated condition, an image not unlike the less than optimal public memory of Patel in modern India.\\nHindol discusses the numerous sacrifices Patel has made in public life bowing to the political ambitions of his peers, while never wavering from his duty to India. The Man who Saved India clearly charts the leadership skills and statesmanship of Patel during the numerous non-cooperation and civil disobedience movements such as Bardoli and Kheda Satyagrahas, and the timely military action in independent India. It was due to the sheer strength of resolve on the part of Patel, which has helped forge the Bharat that was to capture the imagination of the masses of independent India.\\nThe hitherto unknown details of Patel\\'s personal life and his complex relations with his peers and other contemporary national leaders including Gandhi, Nehru, and Bose, help understand the grace with which he gave up political positions more than once. In addition, the author also clearly describes the personal sacrifices Patel has made at the altar of mother India, not only of his personal life, but also of the life of his children, even to the chagrin of his family and friends.\\nThe amazing result of author\\'s copious research is the emergence of an exceptionally clear picture of Patel\\'s life and leadership in the three decades leading up to the independence of India in addition to establishing Patel\\'s key role in the formative years of India following independence, until his death. The Man who Saved India is a timely and much needed historical account of modern India.\\nThe Man who Saved India is a must read for every Indian as well as every person interested in learning the true history of India.\\n- Lavanya Vemsani, Professor, Shawnee State University, Vice President, Ohio Academy of History, President & Cofounder, American Academy of Indic Studies\\nEvery nation has its own narrative that is built over time, even centuries. For India and as Indians we claim ancient ancestry and are therefore, civilisational. Yet, we are a new democratic republic trying to find our place in the new tumultuous 21st century.\\nThere comes a time when we cannot look forward without revisiting our past to see if the narrative of the past was complete, accurate and fair. For decades, the narrative has been that there were essentially two leaders in India - Mahatma Gandhi and his protégé Jawahar Lal Nehru, who together had led the country to independence. Their contribution to the cause of independence was monumental and this became the widely accepted truth. Yet there was another truth, long ignored in our national narrative.\\nHindol Sengupta\\'s book, The Man Who Saved India, provides the other truth. In a meticulously and extensively researched book, the young author brings to the reader the significant role that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel played not only in our struggle for independence but in the consolidation of the new country. Valabhbhai Patel was truly a part of the Trinity, along with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawahar Lal, that led India to freedom. He was the man who ensured that this newfound independence did not collapse in a heap of dust. It was the Sardar who dealt with the reluctant Maharajas, Nawabs and the obdurate Nizam of Hyderabad, when they dreamt of returning to their feudal opulence outside modern India. Patel liquidated the princely states without liquidating the princes. It was his commitment, diplomatic and political skills along with the force of his personality that made unified India a reality.\\nThe book begins with a description of what was once the ancestral home of this great man of India. This decrepit and rather lonely state of the house and its utter neglect is a clear indication that the prevalent narrative preferred to ignore Valabhbhai Patel\\'s contribution. Gandhi knew the value of God and religion in an India that was subjugated. Nehru knew that if India had to talk about its future then there had to be a grand past of aloofness and elitism. It was Patel who was the hard realist who knew that democracy was not about daily plebiscites but hard decisions cloaked in egalitarianism. Nehru looked at the heavens for inspiration Patel looked at the ground beneath his feet for solutions. While Nehru wrote elegant prose and Gandhi spoke to the masses, it was left to Patel to worry over mundane matters about funds and their distribution. Patel was a man of few words and there is every reason to give him credit today for many of his arguments and ideas ranging from tackling Kashmir, the future of Pakistan and how socialism without industrialization could be dangerous for the country. His warnings about Kashmir, Tibet and China went unheeded.\\nThe book is thus not only one of the finest biographies in recent times but is also a much-needed redefining of the roles played by Sardar Patel during India\\'s freedom movement and as the great unifier. The author argues that Patel was not only a pillar of strength behind some of Gandhi\\'s earlier successes to holding the country together.\\nThe author quotes Patel\\'s speech on 5 July 1947 where he warned, \"Our mutual conflicts and internecine quarrels and jealousies have in the past been the cause of our downfall and our falling victim to foreign domination a number of times. We cannot afford to fall into these errors or traps again.\" Sardar Patel was relevant then as he is today. So is Hindol Sengupta\\'s book.\\n- Vikram Sood, bestselling author and the former head of India\\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing\\nThe Man Who Saved India is an excellent deep dive into the life and struggles of one of the tallest leaders in Indian history. Hindol Sengupta written a fascinating book full of insights on things that are rarely discussed - for instance, Patel\\'s economic ideas or his key role as the man who raised critical funds for the Congress Party. This captivating book breaks many myths and throws new light on one of the most important figures in Indian history.\\n- Vijay Govindarajan, NYT and Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Coxe Distinguished Professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College\\nA very engaging biography of Sardar Patel, the man and his times, by one of India\\'s best young writers\\n- Sanjeev Sanyal, bestselling author and Principal Economic Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Government of India\\nThe genre of popular history and biography has been experiencing a golden age and Hindol Sengupta\\'s fluent biography of Sardar Vallabhai Patel joins a list of distinguished titles alongside Michael Axworthy\\'s Sword of Persia, Nadir Shah and Roger Crowley\\'s Constantinople, The Last Great Siege, 1453. Very welcome indeed that an eminently accessible account of the life and achievements of one of India\\'s true great sons is now available to a new generation of readers.\\n- Gautam Sen, lecturer (retd.), London School of Economics and co-author of Analysing the Global Political Economy, Princeton University Press, 2009.\\nRich with detail and illuminating insight, Hindol Sengupta\\'s The Man Who Saved India brings alive Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\\'s indomitable spirit and tenacity in the face of constant challenges that would crush a weaker man. Few people immediately think of Patel when they think of men responsible for the shape and form of modern India. This is a great injustice, for, as Hindol explains with a wealth of anecdote and context, it was Patel who defined the very contours of the India we know today. This book is a must read.\\n- - Saradindu Mukherji, Member, Indian Council of Historical Research\\nHindol writes popular, unpopular history. Another brilliant book, this time putting the untold story of one of India\\'s greatest political leaders in front of today\\'s readers in a way which makes it accessible and unputdownable. His work of putting together Sardar Patel\\'s life story is strikingly accurate yet stunningly engrossing.\\n- Vikramjit Bannerjee, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India, and Advocate General of Nagaland\\n\\'This is one of those rare, great books which every Indian should read. After all, it is also about Vallabhbhai Patel, the man who created the modern state of India out of myriad fragments. Drawing upon a well-researched base of facts and writings, Sengupta emerges as a masterful storyteller who has weaved together a very coherent and absorbing story. The complex relationships among the leaders of the Indian freedom struggle are captured in all their subtle shades and colourful complexity. The end result is, for the reader, a more holistic understanding of Indian history, a much-needed filling up of certain gaps in our knowledge of the past, and a refreshingly enriched perspective on the architects of modern India\\'\\n-N.C.

After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years, Waitzkin expanded his horizons, taking on the martial art Tai Chi Chuan and ultimately earning the title of World Champion.

With soaring prose that celebrates a resurgent American Midwest, Shortest Way Home narrates the heroic transformation of a \"dying city\" (Newsweek) into nothing less than a shining model of urban reinvention.\\nElected at twenty-nine as the nation\\'s youngest mayor, Pete Buttigieg immediately recognized that \"great cities, and even great nations, are built through attention to the everyday.\" As Shortest Way Home recalls, the challenges were daunting?whether confronting gun violence, renaming a street in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., or attracting tech companies to a city that had appealed more to junk bond scavengers than serious investors. None of this is underscored more than Buttigieg\\'s audacious campaign to reclaim 1,000 houses, many of them abandoned, in 1,000 days and then, even as a sitting mayor, deploying to serve in Afghanistan as a Navy officer. Yet the most personal challenge still awaited Buttigieg, who came out in a South Bend Tribune editorial, just before being reelected with 78 percent of the vote, and then finding Chasten Glezman, a middle-school teacher, who would become his partner for life.\\nWhile Washington reels with scandal, Shortest Way Home, with its graceful, often humorous, language, challenges our perception of the typical American politician. In chronicling two once-unthinkable stories?that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a revitalized Rust Belt city no longer regarded as \"flyover country\" Buttigieg provides a new vision for America\\'s shortest way home.': 1,\n",

Furthermore, Butalia reveals how people on the margins of history—children, women, ordinary people, the lower castes, the untouchables—were affected by this upheaval.\\n\\nIn a passionate and stimulating new introduction, Butalia examines not only recent developments in the expanding field of Partition studies but also the heart-breaking ways in which this colossal tragedy continues to impact our lives and what this means for the future of the Indian subcontinent.': 2,\n",

These seven stories represent Mann’s early writing career and a level of literary quality Mann himself despaired of ever again matching. In these stories he began to grapple with themes that were to recur throughout his work. In Little Herr Friedemann, a character’s carefully structured way of life is suddenly threatened by an unexpected sexual passion. In Gladius Dei, puritanical intellect clashes with beauty. In Tristan, Mann presents an ironic and comic account of the tension between an artist and bourgeois society.\\n\\nAll seven of these stories are accomplished and memorable, but it is Death in Venice that truly forms the centerpiece of the collection. The themes that Mann weaves through the shorter pieces come to a climax in this stunning novella, one of the most hauntingly magnificent tales of art and self-destruction ever written.': 1,\n",

Splendidly presented, filled with thoughtful and brilliant intuitive insights.\" —The New Republic\\nIn a brilliant synthesis of words and pictures, Edmund N. Bacon relates historical examples to modern principles of urban planning. He vividly demonstrates how the work of great architects and planners of the past can influence subsequent development and be continued by later generations. By illuminating the historical background of urban design, Bacon also shows us the fundamental forces and considerations that determine the form of a great city. Perhaps the most significant of these are simultaneous movement systems—the paths of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, public and private transportation—that serve as the dominant organizing force, and Bacon looks at movement systems in cities such as London, Rome, and New York. He also stresses the importance of designing open space as well as architectural mass and discusses the impact of space, color, and perspective on the city-dweller. That the centers of cities should and can be pleasant places in which to live, work, and relax is illustrated by such examples as Rotterdam and Stockholm.': 1,\n",

It is necessary that public debates on democracy in India are based on a more informed analysis.

       "         'India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Yet health is not a part of our ambitious development story. In fact, India’s disproportionately stingy healthcare budget makes some of the poorer nations look better in comparison. Statistics, however, speak louder than critics: we have one of the highest numbers of women dying in childbirth and under-five mortality rates. Every year nearly sixty million people get pushed below the poverty line due to the health expenditures that they incur. But there are a few bright spots too: India has eradicated polio and reversed the incidence of HIV/AIDS by an impressive margin.Drawing on her experience as the former union health secretary, K. Sujatha Rao gives us an unsparingly candid insider’s view of India’s health system. This richly detailed book favours increasing the health budget, greater use of technology and providing leadership and good governance. Rao argues that unless good health is prioritized as a national goal, India’s growth story will remain largely self-congratulatory.': 1,\n",

Now, in his beautiful, haunting autobiography, Agassi tells the story of a life framed by such conflicts.\\nAgassi makes us feel his panic as an undersized seven-year-old in Las Vegas, practicing all day under the obsessive gaze of his violent father. We see him at thirteen, banished to a Florida tennis camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning fast return.\\nAnd yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world's best, his greater confusion as he starts to win.

Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.\\nAgassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match, and every public relationship. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals, Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals the depression that shatters his confidence, and the mistake that nearly costs him everything. Finally, he recounts his spectacular resurrection and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.\\nIn clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf.\\nWith its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years.

       "         'Over twenty years ago, Sanjoy Hazarika’s first book on the Northeast, Strangers of the Mist, was published to immediate acclaim. Hailed as an exciting, path-breaking narrative on the region, it has been cited extensively in studies of Northeast India, used as a resource for scholars and journalists and adopted as course material in colleges.\\nTwo decades later, in his new book, armed with more stories, interviews and research and after extensive travels through the region, Hazarika explains how and where things stand in the Northeast today. He examines old and new struggles, contemporary trends and the sweeping changes that have taken place and asks whether the region and its people are still ‘different’ to the rest of India, to each other and whether they are destined to remain so. While it may not be possible to overcome lingering hatred, divisions and differences by brute force, economic might or efforts at cultural or political assimilation, there are other ways forward. These include the process of engagement of accepting, if not embracing, the ‘Idea of India’ and working on forging connections between disparate cultures to overcome the mutual suspicions that have existed for decades. Hazarika tells little-known stories, drawn from personal experience and knowledge, of the way in which insurgents operate, of the reality of border towns in the region, the pain of victims and the courage of fighters on either side of the ideological and physical conflict, in the jungles and in lands awash with rain and swamped by mist. He travels across borders and mountains, listening to tales of the people of the region and those who live in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar. He challenges the stereotype of the ‘North easterner’, critiques the categorization of the ‘Bangladeshi’, deals with issues of ‘race and discrimination’ and suggests best practices that could be used to deal with intractable issues and combatants. Critically, he tries to portray the way in which new generations are grappling with old and current issues with an eye to the future. Extensively researched and brilliantly narrated, strangers no more is arguably the most comprehensive book yet available about India’s Northeast.': 1,\n",

       "         'Finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction: “Nicholas Carr has written a Silent Spring for the literary mind.”—Michael Agger, Slate\\n\\n“Is Google making us stupid?” When Nicholas Carr posed that question, in a celebrated Atlantic Monthly cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the Internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net’s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply?\\n\\nNow, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet’s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by “tools of the mind”—from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer—Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways.\\n\\nBuilding on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic—a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption—and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection.\\n\\nPart intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes—Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive—even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche. This is a book that will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds.': 1,\n",

As early as 1951, China silently and steadily began to work its way onto Indian soil. Even in the face of indisputable evidence, India insisted on maintaining cordial relations with the Chinese. China seemed only too happy to play along. Dalvi narrates the manner in which Indias own political leadership traitorously worked against its cause. In no uncertain terms, he holds three men responsible for Indias defeat - Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon, and General Brij Mohan Kaul. Issuing orders from Delhi, they seemed to be clueless about the situation on the battlefield. Undoubtedly, when they were rushed into battle, the Indian soldiers - underfed, ill-equipped, and unprepared as they were - never stood a chance against the powerful Chinese army. Regardless of that, the soldiers fought bravely and laid down their lives for their homeland. Dalvi claims that the apathy and the sheer ineptitude of those at the helm of Indias political affairs sacrificed hundreds of valuable lives. Brigadier Dalvis detailed narrative of the massacre of the Indian soldiers, a horror that he witnessed firsthand, is heart-rending. The book was published in 1969. Among all the books based on the subject of the 1962 Sino-Indian war, this book is considered to be one the most striking and authentic versions. Due to its sensitive subject matter and its portrayal of Indias leaders in a harshly negative light, the book was banned by the Indian Government upon its release. This particular edition is a 2010 reprint by Natraj Publishers. The book has been translated into Kannada by Ravi Belagere.': 1,\n",

       "         'In 1998, a book was published that was surprisingly ahead of its times. It was called India 2020 and proposed that India could soon be one of the top five economies of the world. The nation had set off a series of nuclear tests and was facing worldwide sanctions. A new government had taken charge, and the economy was facing a tough time. It was not the best of times to predict that India had it in her to get on the fast track to development. The vision presented in the book would go on to inspire, directly or indirectly, many sectors of the economy to work for and achieve high growth.

       "         \"For centuries the nature and meaning of Islamic art has been misunderstood in the West, being regarded as no more than decoration. But in fact the abstract art of Islam represents the sophisticated development of a supra-naturalistic tradition, since the portrayal of human and animal forms has always been discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad, so as to avoid idolatry. Hence, among the world's great artistic traditions, Islamic art has maintained its singular integrity and inner content with the least diversion from its aim: the affirmation of unity as expressed in diversity. The Pythagorean/Platonic doctrines are easily recognizable in the body of Islamic geometric art, as the wisdom of this practice was exalted by Socrates, in Plato's Republic dialogue (527), when he specifically gave the reason for practising geometry. Its practice rekindled the inner organ (or eye of wisdom) by which alone we can see the truth. The geometrical patterns of Islamic art reveal to the eye of the sensitive onlooker the intrinsic cosmological laws affecting all Creation. The primary function of these patterns is to lead the mind from the literal and mundane world towards the underlying permanent reality. The numerous sequential drawings show how the art of Islam is inseparable from the science of mathematics. Thus, we can see clearly how an Earth-centred - 'common-sense' - view of the cosmos gives renewed signficance to the number patterns produced by the orbits of the planets, correlating the cosmos as experienced by man with the patterns created in Islamic art, and thereby throwing new light on the perennial symbolic significance of number. The mathematical tessellations inherent in space-filling patterns are revealed as an essential practical and philosophical basis for the creation of each completed work of art - whether a tile, a carpet, a wall or an entire building - and thus affirm the underlying essential unity of all things.\": 2,\n",

It can be invigorating, sometimes even shocking, like. . . a beautiful curio for sale laid out on a cheap blanket at a street bazaar. ' In the Bazaar of Bad Dreams there is a curio for every reader - a man who keeps reliving the same life, repeating the same mistakes over and over again, a columnist who kills people by writing their obituaries, a poignant tale about the end of the human race and a firework competition between neighbors which reaches an explosive climax. There are also intriguing connections between the stories; themes of morality, guilt, the afterlife and what we would do differently if we could see into the future or correct the mistakes of the past. Effervescent yet poignant, juxtaposing the everyday against the unexpected, these stories comprise one of King's finest gifts to his constant reader as well as to those fascinated by the autobiographical insights in his celebrated nonfiction title On Writing 'I made them especially for you', says King.

In 2014, the company\\'s online transactions totaled $248 billion--more than those of Amazon and eBay combined. The first Chinese entrepreneur to appear on the cover of Forbes, Ma is the now the second-richest man in China, with a net worth that is estimated to be north of $29 billion. Despite Ma\\'s massive influence in China and in the global tech world, his inspirational rags-to-riches story is relatively unknown to the general American public. Never Give Up: Jack Ma In His Own Words is a comprehensive guide to the inner workings of arguably the most prominent figure in the global tech world in the past 20 years--comprised entirely of Ma\\'s own thought-provoking and candid quotes. When Ma decided to start his first Internet company in 1999, few Chinese people knew what the Internet was. Ma, a former English teacher, knew nothing about coding, and his $20,000 in startup funds were not made up of investments from venture capitalists but loans from his family. He channeled his startup experience into Alibaba, a group of websites that allows businesses and people to connect in order to buy and sell products (similar to eBay and Amazon) while also collecting advertising revenue (similar to Google). By some measures, Alibaba is now the largest e-commerce site in the world. In this book, more than 200 quotes on business values, innovation, entrepreneurship, competition, management, teamwork, life, and more provide an intimate and direct look into the mind of this modern business icon and philanthropist. Many of these quotes are translated directly from the Chinese press and interviews. For readers who do not read Chinese and have no other access to these materials, this book provides invaluable insight into the mind of one of the world\\'s most successful business magnates.': 1,\n",

Today, he is a signpost of unity; a reminder of the relevance of Sufism as a conduit of harmony and justice.

On the trail she found her strength, and after a thousand miles of solitude, she found a man who helped her learn to love and trust again—and heal.': 2,\n",

Scandinavian Blanc is different from Scandinavian Noir: there is nothing noir about the world of Ulf Varg, a detective in the Sensitive Crimes Department in the Swedish city of Malmo. Ulf is concerned with very odd, but not too threatening crimes - injuries to the back of the knee caused by an unknown hand, young women who allow their desperation for a boyfriend to get the better of them, and peculiar goings-on in a spa on Sweden's south coast.\\nOf course, Ulf is a Swedish detective, and Swedish detectives, by convention, lead lives beset with problems of one sort or another. For a start, there is his name: Ulf derives from the Old Norse word for wolf and Varg means wolf in modern Swedish. But his character is far from vulpine: Ulf is a sympathetic, well-educated, and likeable man, with a knowledge of and interest in Nordic art. He has a dog called Marten, the only dog in Sweden who is capable of lip-reading (but only in Swedish). Martin becomes depressed and needs treatment. Dogs in Sweden are, apparently, particularly prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder. But this is summer - and there must be something else going on.\\nUlf has a number of colleagues into whose lives we gain an insight. There is Anna, married to an anaesthetist, but very fond of Ulf; there is Erik, whose sole interest is fishing; Carl, whose father has written a book on the Danish philosopher, Kierkegaard; and there is poor Blomquist, from the uniformed branch, who goes on and on about health issues but who seems to have extraordinary luck in investigations. There is also Ulf's psychotherapist, Dr Svensson, whose observations on Ulf's life - and many other topics - enlightens - or possibly confuses.\\nMister Varg introduces us to the world of this typically Scandinavian character and his friends and colleagues.

Dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, Ralston, a seasoned climber, figured he'd hike for a few hours and then head off to work. 40 miles from the nearest paved road, he found himself on top of an 800-pound boulder. As he slid down and off of the boulder it shifted, trapping his right hand against the canyon wall. No one knew where he was; he had little water; he wasn't dressed correctly; and the boulder wasn't going anywhere. He remained trapped for five days in the canyon: hypothermic at night, de-hydrated and hallucinating by day. Finally, he faced the most terrible decision of his life: braking the bones in his wrist by snapping them against the boulder, he hacked through the skin, and finally succeeded in amputating his right hand and wrist. The ordeal, however, was only beginning. He still faced a 60-foot rappell to freedom, and a walk of several hours back to his car - along the way, he miraculously met a family of hikers, and with his arms tourniqued, and blood-loss almost critical, they heard above them the whir of helicopter blades; just in time, Aron was rescued and rushed to hospital. Since that day, Aron has had a remarkable recovery. He is back out on the mountains, with an artificial limb; he speaks to select groups on his ordeal and rescue; and amazingly, he is upbeat, positive, and an inspiration to all who meet him.

The expedition was organized by large-format motion picture producer MacGillivray Freeman Films and was comprised of an international team of climbers. Their goal was to carry a specially modified 48-pound IMAX motion picture camera to the summit of Everest and return from the top of the world with the first footage ever shot there in this spectacular format. A stunningly illustrated portrait of life and death in a hostile, high-altitude environment where no human can survive for long, Everest invites you to join Breashears, his climbers, and his crew as they make photographic history. Author Broughton Coburn traces each step of the team's progress toward a rendezvous with history - and suddenly you're on the scene of a disaster that riveted the world's attention.

The social significance of football was also seen in India during the British Raj when any and every victory by an Indian club over its British counterpart resulted in widespread euphoria. The connotations can be explained with the help of Mohun Bagan’s win over East Yorkshire Regiment in the 1911 IFA Shield. Such was the importance of that victory that it changed an entire country’s perception towards its rulers. Whereas, in the late nineteenth century, the Parsees learned and accepted the British norms of playing cricket, Bagan’s win cemented the notion in the Indian psyche that playing barefoot is the way forward when it clearly was not.\": 1,\n",

So determined is Harry to see Babakov released and the book published, that he puts his own life in danger. His wife Emma, chairman of Barrington Shipping, is facing the repercussions of the IRA attack on the Buckingham. Some board members feel she should resign, and Lady Virginia Fenwick will stop at nothing to cause Emma's downfall. Sir Giles Barrington is now a minister of the Crown, and looks set for even higher office, until an official trip to Berlin does not end as a diplomatic success. Once again, Giles's political career is thrown off balance by none other than his old adversary, Major Alex Fisher, who once again stands against him at the election. But who wins this time? In London, Harry and Emma's son, Sebastian, is quickly making a name for himself at Farthing's Bank in London, and has proposed to the beautiful young American, Samantha. But the despicable Adrian Sloane, a man interested only in his own advancement and the ruin of Sebastian, will stop at nothing to remove his rival.

With all the trademark twists and turns that have made him one of the world's most popular authors, the spellbinding story of the Clifton and the Barrington families continues.\": 1,\n",
       "         'The second edition of this book provides a comprehensive introduction to a consortium of technologies underlying soft computing, an evolving branch of computational intelligence, which in recent years, has turned synonymous to it. The constituent technologies discussed comprise neural network (NN), fuzzy system (FS), evolutionary algorithm (EA) and a number of hybrid systems, which include classes such as neuro-fuzzy, evolutionary-fuzzy and neuro-evolutionary systems. The hybridization of the technologies is demonstrated on architectures such as fuzzy backpropagation network (NN-FS hybrid), genetic algorithm-based backpropagation network (NN-EA hybrid), simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (NN-FS hybrid), fuzzy associative memory (NN-FS hybrid), fuzzy logic controlled genetic algorithm (EA-FS hybrid) and evolutionary extreme learning machine (NN-EA hybrid)\\nEvery architecture has been discussed in detail through illustrative examples and applications. The algorithms have been presented in pseudo-code with a step-by-step illustration of the same in problems. The applications, demonstrative of the potential of the architectures, have been chosen from diverse disciplines of science and engineering.\\nThis book, with a wealth of information that is clearly presented and illustrated by many examples and applications, is designed for use as a text for the courses in soft computing at both the senior undergraduate and first-year postgraduate levels of computer science and engineering.

       "         \"A true-life sporting memoir of one of the best batsman in the game who stunned the cricket world when he prematurely ended his own England career. Trescothick’s brave and soul-baring account of his mental frailties opens the way to a better understanding of the unique pressures experienced by modern-day professional sportsmen.\\nAt 29, Marcus Trescothick was widely regarded as one of the batting greats. With more than 5,000 Test runs to his name and a 2005 Ashes hero, some were predicting this gentle West Country cricket nut might even surpass Graham Gooch's record to become England's highest ever Test run scorer.\\nBut the next time Trescothick hit the headlines it was for reasons no one but a handful of close friends and colleagues could have foreseen.\\nOn Saturday 25 February 2006, four days before leading England into the first Test against India in place of the injured captain Vaughan, Trescothick was out for 32 in the second innings of the final warm-up match. As he walked from the field he fought to calm the emotional storm that was raging inside him, at least to hide it from prying eyes. In the dressing room he broke down in tears, overwhelmed by a blur of anguish, uncertainty and sadness he had been keeping at bay for longer than he knew.\\nWithin hours England's best batsman was on the next flight home. His departure was kept secret until after close of play when coach Duncan Fletcher told the stunned media his acting captain had quit the tour for 'personal, family reasons.'\\nUntil now, the full, extraordinary story of what happened that day and why, of what preceded his breakdown has never been told. He reveals for the first time that he almost flew home from the 2004 tour to South Africa – of what caused it and of what followed – his comeback to the England side and a second crushing breakdown nine months later that left him unable to continue the 2006-07 Ashes tour down under.\\nComing Back to Me replaces the myths and rumours with the truth as Trescothick talks with engaging openness and enthusiasm about his rise to the top of international cricket; and describes with equal frankness his tortured descent into private despair.\": 1,\n",

Since I began teaching technical and business writing in industry years ago, one lesson never grew old an exercise on when to write the right word. Many writers confuse complement when they mean compliment, compose when they mean comprise, or assume when they mean presume. And hundreds of other mistaken word identities also exist. This Quick reference aims to filter this confusion of words. Remember, writing is much easier to comprehend when the noise around it is eliminated.\\nThough not inclusive of all word pair mistakes, this book speaks to the common word choices that challenge us daily. This book consists of more than 900 entries and the meanings of more than 2,000 individual words or phrases. Much of the content is based on word problems I've witnessed during my 25 years of business writing as well as the misuse commonly found in the online and print media. If you're looking for the basic homonyms such as to, too and two, or here and hear, you won't find them here. But you will find the basic pronoun possessives (their, they're, there, who's and whose and you're and your) because they still give us problems. I've tried to eliminate obvious synonyms (inedible vs. uneatable, simultaneous vs. concurrently, rare vs. scarce, etc.) and include just word pairs where the word distinction is still important yet challenging.\\nNote that a few entries may seem trivial and others may seem a bit obscure or obsolete. But overall you'll find it a good mix of problem words (among vs. between, flounder vs. founder, blatant vs. flagrant), Also included are a few notes on phrases that often lead to problem writing (between you and I, one of the only and others). For each entry in this reference, the difference between the words is explained and in most cases, a short and simple sentence example showing the correct usage is provided.

Out of the chaos, however, a single charismatic voice is starting to be heard - that of Igor Komarov, a visionary patriot who claims he can restore Russia's greatness and bring prosperity to the masses. He even woos Western political leaders with a rather more realistic analysis of the way forward for Russia. Komarov is set to win the next election when a document is smuggled into the British Embassy in Moscow. It's called The Black Manifesto and it appears to show Komarov's secret agenda - his political blueprint is really Mein Kampf, the rebirth of Russia will be as a New Third Reich with Komarov as Fuhrer. But can the document be authenticated? And what can the Western Alliance's most secret Trilateral Commission do about it if it is? They need to find another voice the masses will listen to and obey rather than Komarov - an icon they can cleave to and trust. Once, not that long ago, he was called the Tsar.\\n\\nAnd so develops a thrilling and increasingly frightening adventure - Jason Monk, ex-CIA, who used to run agents into the Soviet Union, is recruited and slips back into Russia, into the desperate Moscow world of poverty, luxury, gangsters and prostitutes and underneath it all, the titanic power struggle to ensure the outcome of the forthcoming elections.\": 1,\n",

Societies and religions force us into models and thought-forms that are often in opposition to an organic model of love, which is instead institutionalized by marriage, religious affiliations, and nationalism. This results in love that is, for most people, a painful challenge in one form or another throughout life.\\nIn these modern days, where the focus shifts more and more to realizing one’s individual potential, Osho’s The Power of Love: What Does It Take for Love to Last a Lifetime? helps us to direct our search for love by widening our view―showing us that love has many manifestations and is not limited to the “other”. One manifestation of love is meditation, a life-changing experience that allows the flowering of real love within oneself and toward others.\\nOsho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century” and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people―along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha―who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.': 2,\n",

That is what makes the book relatable even though it has been written by someone who’s the daughter of celebrities and married to one. Through her own anecdotes and by drawing parallels between a star’s life and a normal life, she has managed to write a book which is funny yet at the same time it forces you to think and comment on the situation.

Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all.\\n \\nMagi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his body—though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death.

She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival.\\n \\nLocke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills.

You\\'ll also benefit from Mr. Hultgren\\'s expert\\nadvice and tips on catching the essential movement and character of animals and avoiding the stiff, wooden poses that are the frequent and unfortunate result of much sketching of animals from life. Throughout, the emphasis is on construction drawings (there are over 700 line illustrations and halftones) rather than on text. This means the student is able to view the development process of the drawing by example rather than theory or description.\\nThe book begins with introductory chapters on the special techniques of drawing animals, the use of line, establishing mood and feeling, conveying action, and brush techniques. Mr. Hultgren then turns to individual animal forms — horses, deer, cats, cows and bulls, giraffes, camels, gorillas, pigs, and many more. His instruction on animal caricature will be especially valuable to the legions of artists avidly interested in the subject.\\nThe Art of Animal Drawing belongs in the library of any artist — student, amateur, or professional — who is interested in drawing animals.': 1,\n",

It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood; he lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.'

Tenali Raman was an embodiment of acute wit and humour and an admirable poet of knowledge, shrewdness and ingenuity. In a short span, the legacy left behind by Tenali Raman attained eternity. All these qualities of Tenali Raman have been fully explored and displayed in this collection of vibrant fables and anecdotes. The book is a marvellous treasury of legends of Tenali Raman and Emperor Raya which evokes a long lost, never-never land: an enchanted world of alert wits and tricky gossips; crafty crooks with biting tongues, valiant brigands and an assorted cluster of uncommon common people. Narrated by the author and superbly illustrated, “Fix Your Problems–The Tenali Raman Way” is an engaging blend of earthly wisdom and sparkling humour which deal with concepts that have certain timelessness. Each story is followed by terse moral and incalculable snippets which are usually that little extra that brings the reader a little more closer to his goal on the way to realisation. Every story purveys a pithy folk wisdom that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The moralistic traits sagaciously portrayed by these stories intend to develop a series of impacts that can reinforce certain key ideas by the rational mind of the readers in all facets of life and propel them to the top in every endeavour. The stories' various layers of meaning educates, informs, advises, enthuses, inspires and amuses and thus have a teaching effect which makes this book a must read for every aspiring individual who wants to race ahead in the world of opportunities and cusses.

Since the early 1990s, during the era of neo-liberal reforms, while economic growth has remained upbeat, the wellbeing of the masses has shown even greater stress.\\nAn indispensable entry point to the subject of labour in India, this Short Introduction locates the debate within the trajectory of economic development since India’s independence.': 1,\n",

       "         'India’s greatest film-maker on the art and craft of films. Exactly fifty years ago, in 1955, the release of Pather Panchali heralded the arrival of a master in the world of cinema. Over the next forty years, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the world’s finest film-makers ever. Today, more than a decade after his death, he continues to be India’s most respected name in international film circles. Apart from his achievements as a director, Ray was also a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and essays on cinema. Speaking of Films brings together some of Ray’s most memorable writings on film and film-making. With the masterly precision and clarity that characterize his films, Ray discusses a wide array of subjects: the structure and language of cinema with special reference to his adaptations of Tagore and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, the appropriate use of background music and dialogue in films, the relationship between a film-maker and a film critic, and important developments in cinema like the advent of sound and color. He also writes about his own experiences, the challenges of working with rank amateurs, and the innovations called for when making a film in the face of technological, financial and logistical constraints. In the process, Ray provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of the people who worked with him—the intricacies of getting Chhabi Biswas, who had no ear for music, to play a patron of classical music in Jalsaghar; the incredible memory of the seventy-five-year-old Chunibala Devi, Indir Thakrun of Pather Panchali, and her remarkable attention to details. This first-ever translation of Bishay Chalachitra, a seminal collection of essays on cinema, Speaking of Films retains the lucidity and simplicity that is a hallmark of Ray’s writing, and gives an invaluable insight into the mind of a genius.': 2,\n",

       "         'The book is a study of the fundamental principles of ancient Indian art and architecture, dealing with essentials of Hindu thinking and practice of art like the Hindu view of Godhead, iconography and iconometry, and symbols and symbolism in Hindu art. Referring to major classical Indian literary works shedding light on art and architecture, it undertakes a survey of Indian art and temple architecture from the 3rd century bc through the medieval period, highlighting the directional changes that marked the history of art, specifically sculpture and painting. It elaborately views the various terms and concepts associated with the field of art and iconography like mudras, asanas, pithas, explaining the nature of Buddhist and Jain deities as well as those of Hindu sects like Saivism, Vaisnavism and Saktism. Pointing out the importance of studying Hindu temple architecture in order to fully appreciate Hindu art which was meant for propagation of dharma, it analyses the basic features of the temple architecture and its regional variants. Tracing the differences in conception and delineation of a Hindu temple, a Muslim mosque and a Christian church, the research focuses particularly on the principles of visualisation of symbols and signs in Hinduism and Christianity. It also reveals how the West has viewed Indian literature and art, exposing the inner contradictions of some European thinkers who while praising literary works of Kalidasa and others condemned the Hindu images. The work contains more than 200 illustrations, half-tone and line drawings, that make the discussion easy to comprehend for a range of readers scholars, students as well as laymen.': 1,\n",
